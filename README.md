# Overview

I primarily code in Python and I wanted to expand the knowledge of programming by learning another programming language. Because I primarily deal with C# at work, I felt it was best to learn how to write it so that I can read it.

This executable makes it so that a dnd 5e player can easily create a character through randomly generated ability scores. I typically play a lot of "one-shots," DnD campaigns that last only one session. Being able to easily roll all my stats makes it so that I can spend more time writing the backstory.
